  description: "My name is Zaitullah Jan. I am a dedicated software developer with a unique background as a former Afghan soldier who served alongside U.S. forces as an interpreter and cultural liaison. My military service taught me discipline, teamwork, and the importance of clear communication across cultures. Now, I channel these skills into software development, where I bring the same dedication and precision to creating innovative solutions. I am passionate about using technology to bridge gaps and solve real-world problems. My experience working in high-pressure environments has made me a resilient and adaptable developer who thrives on challenges.",
